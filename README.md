# Random Python Trolls, Pranks.

Random scripts (.exe or .py) to troll friends or...

### Features (at this moment):
- Open new desktop
- Spam Windows Explorer (use with caution in low-end PC)
> Maybe crash explorer.exe or lag the PC if use the 'laggy' version
- Open Browser and Play "Rick Rolled" song
- Win + D spam
- Write "You Have Been Hacked!" in Everything Focused!
- Open Desktop and Turn Off PC (via alt+f4)
- Directly Shutdown

### Obs:

You need to manually cover the prank .exe or .py by yourself (for a good reason: I can not know which type of application the victim is waiting for, but I will leave the .exe and .py already coded in releases)
- Maybe some .py will have config parameters (like infinite code with while repeat or something like that) and need to manually get changed.
- Maybe some low-end computers can have problems in running manual pranks (like manual shutdown via alt f4)
- If any option doesn't have a native .exe in folder, you are going to need to create one if you don't want to use .py

- **Windows Defender** maybe see a .exe as a threat (pyinstaller, py2exe & etc.). All .py is also included in the release.
> obsÂ² - A way to workaround it is the use of a encryptor to 'protect' your code, like base64 or Fernet & etc. You can encrypt my .py to chill Windows Defender.

### Caution:
- Before read the others cautions, remember, there are some infinite .py versions (and infinite configurable parameters, use with caution).
- There is only some scripts that will use a large amount of ram, disk or cpu. It is supposed to be fun and harmless, just a prank, be careful.
- Maybe the Spam Scripts in laggy version crash the software that is supposed to be 'spammed' or lag the victim PC.
